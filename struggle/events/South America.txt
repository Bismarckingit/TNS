The Selbapunic empire looks with suspicion on the revolt, believing it could also spread to their Guaranì subjects. The tribesmen have began razing the lands, killing and enslaving outsiders in their land, and managed to steal many weapons from Quechua barracks in most towns.

The High Chief declared the town the new capital of his kingdom and said that any Selbapunic that would try to walk in their lands would be slowly tortured and killed.
